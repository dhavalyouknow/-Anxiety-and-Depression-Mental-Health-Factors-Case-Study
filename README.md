Anxiety and Depression: Mental Health Factors
This project involves a detailed analysis of a dataset focused on anxiety and depression to better understand the factors that influence mental health. The objective was to identify patterns, trends, and correlations between different variables such as demographics, lifestyle habits, and reported mental health conditions.

The dataset provided information on age, gender, sleep habits, exercise frequency, social interactions, and symptoms related to anxiety and depression. The analysis aimed to answer important questions like:

Which age groups are most affected by anxiety and depression?

How do lifestyle habits such as sleep and exercise relate to mental health?

Are there notable differences in mental health conditions across different demographics?

Through the exploration of the data, key observations were made:

Younger individuals showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms.

Poor sleep habits and lack of regular exercise were closely linked to mental health challenges.

Gender differences were observed, with certain groups experiencing higher mental health concerns.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were established, including the percentage of individuals affected by anxiety and depression and correlations between lifestyle factors and mental health status.

No programming languages or visualization tools were used in this project. The focus remained purely on the interpretation and understanding of the dataset by manually analyzing the values, comparing groups, and identifying meaningful trends.

This project provides important insights into mental health issues based purely on data analysis. The findings can help inform future research, promote mental health awareness, and guide efforts toward developing preventive measures and support strategies for those affected by anxiety and depression.
